A JSON Schema validator implementation in Java which aims for correctness and
performance, in that order

<h1>What this is</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>This implementation is meant to be purely server-side if Java is your
language of choice. You may, <b>or may not</b>, use it in your Java Web
application; this library has no dependencies on anything Web-related.</p>

<h2>Extensibility</h2>

<p>This project uses the infrastructure provided by <a
href="https://github.com/fge/json-schema-core">json-schema-core</a>, which
means you can use all the power in this library to include the processors
provided in this package into your own custom chains.</p>

<p>What is more, you can define your own schemas, with dedicated keywords and/or
format attributes.</p>

<h2>Strong points</h2>

<p>This library has complete draft v3 and draft v4 validation support.</p>

<p>It also has three particular features making it stand apart:</p>

<ul>
    <li>regular expressions obey ECMA 262 (ie, those are JavaScript regular
    expressions);</li>
    <li><b>it can validate numeric JSON data or abitrary scale/precision</b>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>Sample usage</h1>

<p>There are code examples in package {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.examples} which you can use to get started.</p>

<h1>The validation process</h1>

<p>The validation process is a five step process:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: monospace">$ref</span> resolution;</li>
    <li>schema syntax validation;</li>
    <li>schema digesting;</li>
    <li>keyword building;</li>
    <li>instance validation (ie, validate your data).</li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="font-family: monospace">$ref</span> resolution</h2>

<p>This is a critically important part of the validation process. You may
encounter, during validation, what is called a <a
href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-03">JSON
Reference</a>. A JSON Reference is a JSON Object with one member named
<span style="font-family: monospace">$ref</span>, and the value of this member
is a text value which embodies a URI. Implementations are required to follow
JSON References until an actual final content is reached (and this content may,
or may not, be a valid JSON Schema).</p>

<p>Also, consider this schema:</p>

<pre>
    {
        "$ref": "some://where/else",
        "minimum": 3
    }
</pre>

<p>This is <b>still</b> a JSON Reference. Other schema keywords, such as
<span style="font-family: monospace">minimum</span> in this example, should be
<b>ignored</b>. And this is what this implementation does.</p>

<p>Note that any failure in $ref validation is considered a fatal error.</p>

<p>The processor in charge of this step is {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.processors.ref.RefResolver}. It is located in package
<span style="font-family: monospace">json-schema-core</span>.</p>

<h2>Schema syntax checking</h2>

<p>This is an equally important part of the validation process. One thing to
note about the previous step is that it will only check that JSON Reference
resolution ultimately leads to a JSON document, whatever that document is. Which
means it may not even be a JSON Object, therefore not a JSON Schema. This basic
check is done at that level.</p>

<p>After schema syntax checking is done, you are ensured that the schema is well
formed: this simplifies later processing. Note however that syntax checking will
not follow JSON References.</p>

<p>The processor in charge of this step is {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.processors.syntax.SyntaxProcessor}. It is located in
the <span style="font-family: monospace">json-schema-core</span> package.</p>

<h2>Digesting</h2>

<p>This step of the processing chain takes into account both the schema and the
instance to validate. Its role is to check the instance type, pick the relevant
keywords for that instance type into the current schema, and build digested
forms of these keywords for the next step.</p>

<p>For instance, consider that you are validating a number instance, and the
current schema reads:</p>

<pre>
    {
        "minItems": 3,
        "maximum": 3
    }
</pre>

<p>{@code minItems} does not apply to numbers, it will therefore be filtered out
here. But this is not all. Now consider those two schemas:</p>

<pre>
    {
        "additionalItems": true
    }
</pre>

<pre>
    {
        "additionalItems": { "type": "string" }
    }
</pre>

<p>They have exactly the same influence on the validation of the array itself
(note: the array, <b>not</b> its elements). The digest for these two schemas
when the instance to validate is an array will therefore be the same. This
allows to prune a lot of duplicates out of keyword caching.</p>

<p>The processor in charge of this step is {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.processing.digest.SchemaDigester}.</p>

<h2>Keyword building</h2>

<p>At this step, the digested form of the current schema is grabbed and all
relevant keywords are built (if they are not found in the cache). The real
validation can now take place.</p>

<p>Again, all results are cached for future reuse. And as all keywords are
context-free, a same result can be reused across different schemas.</p>

<p>The processor in charge of this step is {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.processors.build.ValidatorBuilder}.</p>

<h2>Instance (aka data) validation</h2>

<p>This is the part which actually matters to end users: ensure that their data
is valid.</p>

<p>This step of the processing consists of two distinct elements:</p>

<ul>
    <li>running the keyword validators built at the previous step;</li>
    <li>(recursively) validating children of arrays and/or objects.</li>
</ul>

<p>As some keywords require that this very same processor be called again, all
keyword validators keep a reference to it: this is what also allows keywords
such as {@code anyOf}, {@code allOf} and others to work correctly. In a similar
manner, this processor also needs a reference to the start of the chain (the
reference resolver processor).</p>

<p>The processor in charge of this step is {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.processors.validation.ValidationProcessor}.</p>
